## Building Docker Images

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your system. If you haven't installed Docker yet, you can download and install it from [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

### Build Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

    ```bash
    cd your-project
    ```

3. Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile.

    ```bash
    docker build -t your-image-name .
    ```

    Replace `your-image-name` with the desired name for your Docker image.

4. Once the build is complete, you can run a container using the following command:

    ```bash
    docker run -d -p your-port:container-port your-image-name
    ```

    Replace `your-port` with the port you want to expose on your host machine and `container-port` with the port your application is running inside the container.

### Additional Information

- If you need to customize the build process, you can modify the `Dockerfile` according to your requirements.
- For more advanced usage, refer to the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/).
